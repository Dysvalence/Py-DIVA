README

This is a python & numpy based implementation of the Divergent Autoencoder(DIVA) model of human category learning (Kurtz, 2007), configured to run on the MNIST dataset as a machine learning algorithm. 

As the name suggests, this branch is being used to develop a theano based implementation to allow for higher speeds and GPU usage.
